DESCRIPTION_BRIEF	A proton-transporting two-sector ATPase complex that catalyzes the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP during oxidative phosphorylation. The complex comprises a membrane sector (F0) that carries out proton transport and a cytoplasmic compartment sector (F1) that catalyzes ATP synthesis by a rotational mechanism; the extramembrane sector (containing 3 a and 3 b subunits) is connected via the d-subunit to the membrane sector by several smaller subunits. Within this complex, the g and e subunits and the 9-12 c subunits rotate by consecutive 120 degree angles and perform parts of ATP synthesis. This movement is driven by the hydrogen ion electrochemical potential gradient. [ISBN:0198547684, ISBN:0716743663]
